== Water Ponding and Hot Start ==
* Description: When reading a closed basin with a hot start file the input card WATER_PONDING ON has to be used or the current velocities are set to zero.

== Hot Start and Multiple-sized Sediment Transport ==
* Description: When hot starting a simulation with multiple-sized sediment transport, the model develops instabilities which would otherwise not occur without the hot start.

== Hot Start/Initial Condition ASCII Input for Salinity and Sediment Transport ==
* Description: The Hot start option with ASCII input only supports the wse and current velocities. It does not not support salinity and Sediemnt Transport yet.

== Precondition ILUP Access Violation ==
* Description: Problem using the preconditioner ILUP for a specific case by Paul Morris (paul.morris1269@gmail.com). The case is a simple rectangular grid. Alex and Mitch tried to debug the source code but could not resolve the issue. Other solvers such as the SIP worked well for the same case. Mitch also had success in running the grid with a few land-boundary cells made inactive (cells with 3 neighboring inactive cells).

== Variable Step Time Problem ==
* Description: When running mid-term simulations, sometimes the time step is reduced due to a large forcing conditions such as a storm but then the variable time stepping algorithm does not increase the time step back up again, and the simulation continues with a small time step.

== Bed Roughness Calculation ==
* Description: Currently the bed roughness is specified for the hydrodynamic calculations. Depending on the sediment transport formula, this roughness may or may not be used in the sediment transport calculations. A more consistent approach is needed in which the bottom roughness is estimated based on the local bed composition and bed forms and used by both the hydrodynamic and sediment transport routines.
