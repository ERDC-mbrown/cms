! Sediment Load Correction Factor Library
!
! Description:
!   The corrections factors for bed, suspended, and total loads
!   are related to the time lag or horizontal speed of the 
!   loads relative to the depth-averaged current velocity. 
!   This is caused by the fact that sediment moves close to the 
!   bed where the current velocites are lower compared to the 
!   depth-averaged value.
!
! Routines:
!   bslogexp - Computes the suspended load correction factor
!             analytically using logarithmic-velocity and 
!             exponential-sediment profiles
!   bslogexp_table - Interpolates the suspended load correction factor based
!             on a log velocity and exponential concentration vertical
!             profiles from a look-up table
!   bslogrouse_table - Interpolates the suspended load correction factor based
!             on a log velocity and Rouse concentration vertical
!             profiles from a look-up table
!   bs_init - Initializes the look-up tables for the suspended load 
!             correction factor
