Coastal Modeling System
=======================

The Coastal Modeling System is an integrated suite of numerical models for simulating flow, waves, sediment transport, and morphology change in coastal areas. The system is designed for practical applications in navigation channel performance and sediment management for coastal inlets and adjacent beaches in order to improve the usage of USACE Operation and Maintenance Funds. The CMS is intended as a research and engineering tool that can be used on desktop computers. The CMS takes advantage of the Surface-water Modeling System (SMS) interface for grid generation and model setup, as well as plotting and post-processing.

This documentation describes implementation of CMS on Windows and Linux and various features of the CMS. The source code of the Fortran implementation can be found in `GitHub <https://github.com/erdc/cms2d>`_.
