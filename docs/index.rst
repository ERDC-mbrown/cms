Coastal Modeling System Documentation
=====================================

The Coastal Modeling System is an integrated 2D numerical modeling system for simulating waves, current, water level, sediment transport, and morphology change at coastal inlets and entrances. Emphasis of the CMS is on navigation channel performance and sediment exchange between the inlet and adjacent beaches. A key objective of this work is to develop, test, and transfer the CMS to Corps Districts and industry for use on specific engineering studies.

This documentation describes implementation of CMS on Windows and Linux and various features of the CMS. The source code of the Fortran implementation can be found in `GitHub <https://github.com/erdc/cms2d>`_.
